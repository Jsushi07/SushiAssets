Oh boy, here I go playing this game again
Screwed up since 1949
We were bad, but now we're worse.
Count the bodies
I need my knife, where is it?
M I am watching you
You son of a trash can, I'm in!
I told my computer I needed a break, and now it won't stop sending me vacation ads. I think it needs a break too.
I need to get out of this basement (send help)
Mom can we have roles? We have roles at home.
What is this for?
Please get me out of this continent
Reverie is watching us all
Maybe it was not your day? well tomorrow will be worse if you ask me.
I'm on a whiskey diet. I've lost three days already.
Man I'm ded.
I'm reading a book on anti-gravity. It's impossible to put down.

Don't ever say Serial Killer in the short way in front of Jsushi.
Rufus I am watching you
